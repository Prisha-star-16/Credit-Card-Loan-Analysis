## 📝 Business Problem

Lending companies face a significant challenge when approving loans for individuals with inadequate or missing credit histories. This project addresses the core business problem of loan approval decisions, which involve two main risks:

* **Business Loss:** Rejecting a loan application from an individual who is likely to repay.
* **Financial Loss:** Approving a loan for an individual who is likely to default.

By leveraging data analysis, we aim to build a data-driven strategy to help the company make more informed decisions, ensuring that capable applicants are not wrongly rejected.
